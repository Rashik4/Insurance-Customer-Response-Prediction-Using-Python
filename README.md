# Insurance-Customer-Response-Prediction-Using-Python
Insurance industry project focused on predicting customer responses to policy offers using machine learning. The goal is to enhance customer behavior understanding and improve targeted marketing strategies, leading to better conversion rates.
Key Steps Involved:

    Data Exploration & Preprocessing
        Handling missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.
        Exploring correlations and distributions.

    Feature Engineering
        Transforming categorical variables (e.g., "Vehicle_Age").
        Creating new features if needed.

    Model Selection & Evaluation
        Trying Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
        Using metrics like accuracy, precision-recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

    Comparative Analysis & Optimization
        Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearch, RandomizedSearch).
        Comparing models for the best performance.

    Deliverables
        Trained ML model for predicting customer responses.
        Data visualizations for insights.
        Comparative report on algorithm performance.
